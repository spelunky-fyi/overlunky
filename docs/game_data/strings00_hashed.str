0x2544d54b: It's unbelievable! There's a giant Olmec on the surface of the Moon! And a cave! A feeling of deja vu swept over us, and we were drawn toward the entrance like iron filings to a magnet. A voice is calling to us... is it Olmec, or something else?
0x326b7195: We've been in the Moon for what feels like many months already, but it's hard to tell. Just like before, time and death work differently here.\n\nIt feels like we've slipped into another crack in the Universe... like the Cave of Olmec... connected to it, perhaps... but also bigger, much bigger!
0xcd113fc9: Ana, if you're reading this, then you've probably guessed that Mom and Dad are somewhere down below, trying to find a way out. I'm sorry, we should have brought you with us! But try not to worry. To be honest, we're having fun! Take your time and don't rush. Remember, it's easier to get hurt if you're not careful.
0x30a134c3: Just remember what we taught you and you'll be fine. This journal is yours now! Make the most of it and we'll see you soon!
0xe77c4975: Happy Spelunky-ing!
